# Pearson Correlation 
correlation <- cor(data$Income, 
                   data$SpendingScore, 
                   method = "pearson", 
                   use = "complete.obs") 
print(correlation) 

#Interpretation: 
#• Positive value → Higher income customers tend to spend more.  
#• Negative value → Higher income customers spend less.  
#• Value close to 1 or -1 indicates strong relationship.  
#• Value near 0 indicates weak relationship. 

#2. Test significance of the correlation. What conclusion can be drawn? 
  # Correlation significance test 
  cor_test <- cor.test(data$Income, 
                       data$SpendingScore, 
                       method = "pearson")

#Conclusion: 
#• If p-value < 0.05 → Correlation is statistically significant.  
#• If p-value > 0.05 → No significant relationship exists.  

#3. Generate a normal distribution using Income and compare with actual data. 
# Histogram of actual Income 
hist(data$Income, 
     probability = TRUE, 
     main = "Income Distribution",

# Generate normal curve 
x <- seq(min(data$Income), 
         max(data$Income), 
         length = 100) 

y <- dnorm(x, 
           mean = mean(data$Income), 
           sd = sd(data$Income))

#4. Perform a one-sample t-test to check if average income is ₹50,000. 
# One-sample t-test 
t_test <- t.test(data$Income, 
                 mu = 50000) 

t_test 

#Conclusion: 
#• p-value < 0.05 → Mean income significantly differs from ₹50,000.  
#• p-value > 0.05 → Mean income is approximately ₹50,000.  

#5. Test whether purchase success rate differs from 50% using binomial test. 
# Convert Purchase to success count 
success <- sum(data$Purchase == "Yes") 
print(success)

# Binomial test 
binom_test <- binom.test(success, 
                         total, 
                         p = 0.50)
